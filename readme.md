You get 10% for each one of the questions below:

1. Git: To get the mark for the Git portion of the quiz make sure you submit each of the questions below in a separate commit to a repo on Github.

2. Stacks & Queues: Explain the difference between a stack and a queue. Write a Ruby class called Stack and another Ruby class called Queue. Each class should have two instance methods `add` and `remove` to add an element to the stack or queue or to remove an element from the stack or queue. Make sure that each class behaves properly as per definitions of stacks and queues.

3. Given a JavaScript object that looks like this:
?
1
var majorCities = {BC: ["Vancouver", "Victoria", "Prince George"], AB: ["Edmonton", "Calgary"]};
Write a piece of code that loops through the object and prints the following to the console: BC has 3 main cities AB has 2 main cities  

4. Write a JavaScript function called: isPrime. The function must take a number n and it should return `true` or `false` whether the argument passed (n) is a prime number or not. A prime number is a number that is divisible only by 1 and itself.

5. Write a function in JavaScript that takes in a number n and returns the first n even numbers.

6. Implement question #5 again in Ruby in two ways:
    a. Using a loop
    b. Using recursion
   Benchmark the two solutions (include your code for the benchmarking). Which one of your solutions is faster?

7. Implement the following code in Ruby: Create a module called HelperMethods that include a method called `titleize` that does the following: it takes in a string and returns the string back after capitalizing each word in that string. For example if you pass to the method a string "hello world" you should get back "Hello World". The methods should not capitalize the following words: in, the, of, and, or, from.

8. Create a Ruby class called Article inside a module called Blog that has two attributes: title and body. Write another class called Snippet that inherits from the Article class. The Snippet method should return the same `title` but if you call `body` on a snippet object it should return the body truncated to a 100 characters with three dots at the end. This means if you create a snippet object and give it a body that has 200 characters, if you call the `body` method it should return the first 100 characters of that body and three dots at the end. If the body is 100 characters or less, it should not put three dots at the end. Include the module you built in question #7 in the Article class and use it when returning the title.

9. Build a Ruby class called "Book". Objects of the Book class must have two attributes: title and chapters. Objects must have two methods: add_chapter and chapters. The `add_chapter` methods adds a chapter by giving it a title. The chapters method should display the number of chapters and lists all the chapters as in:
?
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
book = Book.new
book.title = "My Awesome Book"
book.add_chapter("My Awesome Chapter 1")
book.add_chapter("My Awesome Chapter 2")
book.chapters
# This should print:
# Your book: My Awesome Book has 2 chapters:
# 1. My Awesome Chapter 1
# 2. My Awesome Chapter 2


10. Write a piece of code to demonstrate the difference between `include` and `extend` in using Ruby modules with classes to include methods. Make sure to demonstrate calling the methods with your code.

11. BONUS: Rewrite the method `titleize` in question #7 without mutating any variable.
